# My-Portfolio
A portfolio I made for the coursera course "IBM Full Stack Developer"


Some of this code is not mine. It is the starting code for the project, but I am allowed to put it on here. This file includes index.htmo, script.js, and style.css. All of these are free to use, as long as you give credit to me for the new "starting code". Hope you enjoy!
